  <p>Thanks so much for watching Fido this weekend! Here's everything you need to know while I'm gone.</p>

  <p>Here's a bit of history about Fido.</p>

    <p>Fido likes to play.</p>

  <div class="important">

  <p>Fido is allergic to a lot of foods.</p>

  <p>Also, here are a list of things that you should do with Fido every day:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Walk him</li>
    <li>Feed him</li>
    <li>Pet him</li>
  </ul>
</div>
